### Fonts
- I decided to use Open Sans as the font as it is used throughout Unum's website as the main font.

### Colours
- I decided to use the same blue (#015294) that Unum use on their website for the background of the navbar and white (#fff) for the font.
- I used the same blue as the navbar for the plus minus buttons.
- The text inside the table is black.
The main background of the website is white which is the same as Unum's website. 

### Icons
- I used font awesome for the fonts on this site.
